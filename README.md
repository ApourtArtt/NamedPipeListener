# NamedPipeListener
I needed something like IO Ninja to read/write in named pipe, but there is only a 7 days trial version. So here is my version of a named pipe listener. It is using Qt (5.14), you can download a [release](https://github.com/ApourtArtt/NamedPipeListener/releases) if you do not have the library.
